# **C\# Learning Archive**

### **Description**
This is an archive of all the tasks I have completed on my Introduction to Programming course, which commenced on September 14th 2022 and ended on December 17th 2022. This was a foundational course meant to welcome and immerse future programmers into the field; with C# serving as the introductory programming language due to its intuitive design and the large community of experts and learners alike.
